## Overview

This ongoing research combines numerical modeling with cutting-edge data assimilation techniques and machine learning to study coastal and estuarine dynamics. Current focus areas include bay-shelf exchange processes, mesoscale eddies, and water mass transformation in various coastal systems.

## Current Research (NCSU, 2024-Present)

### Gulf of Mexico Eddies
- Using numerical models and ML/AI to study mesoscale eddy dynamics
- Developing data assimilation techniques to enhance ocean model accuracy

### Caribbean Sea Water Mass Transformation
- Investigating water mass transformation processes
- Applying advanced modeling and machine learning approaches

## Previous Research (UNSW, 2022-2024)

### Batemans Bay, Australia
