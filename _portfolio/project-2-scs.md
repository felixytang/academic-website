## Overview

This project investigates the low-frequency variability of shelf circulation in the Northern South China Sea, with a focus on understanding how climatic forcing modulates cross-shelf water exchange. This research has important implications for understanding nutrient transport, ecosystem dynamics, and regional climate variability.

## Key Research Questions

- What climatic factors control the interannual variability of shelf circulation?
- How do coastally-trapped waves modulate water exchange in the Taiwan Strait?
- What are the physical mechanisms governing cross-shelf transport?

## Methods

- **Numerical Modeling**: Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)
- **Data Analysis**: Long-term observational records and reanalysis products
- **Focus Areas**: Northern South China Sea, Taiwan Strait, East China Sea
