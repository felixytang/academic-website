## Overview

This project focuses on understanding the dynamics of Pacific water inflow through the Bering Strait and its far-reaching impacts on the Arctic Ocean system. The Bering Strait serves as the only Pacific gateway to the Arctic, making it a critical chokepoint for heat, freshwater, and nutrient transport.

## Key Research Questions

- What controls the seasonal and interannual variability of Bering Strait throughflow?
- How does the throughflow influence sea ice extent in the Chukchi Sea?
- What are the air-ice-sea interaction mechanisms in this region?

## Methods

- **Numerical Modeling**: Arctic Ocean FVCOM (AO-FVCOM) simulations
- **Observational Analysis**: In situ mooring data and satellite observations
- **Regions**: Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago
