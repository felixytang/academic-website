I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physical Oceanography at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). My research focuses on multi-scale ocean dynamics, air-sea-ice interactions, and cross-shelf water exchange. I employ numerical ocean models (ROMS, FVCOM) combined with data assimilation techniques and ML/AI approaches to investigate ocean circulation and climate dynamics.

## Current Research

At NCSU, I am conducting advanced research with a focus on:
- **Data assimilation techniques** to enhance ocean model accuracy
- **Eddies in the Gulf of Mexico** using numerical models and ML/AI
- **Water mass transformation** in the Caribbean Sea

## Research Interests

- Physical oceanography and multi-scale ocean dynamics
- Air-sea-ice interactions and cross-shelf water exchange
- Numerical modeling and data assimilation
- Climate change impacts on coastal and polar ocean systems
