summary: Presentation on real-time ocean forecasting and adaptive sampling strategies for coordinated multi-platform oceanographic operations.

abstract: |
  This presentation discusses the development and implementation of real-time optimal planning algorithms for multi-platform oceanographic operations in the Gulf of Mexico. We demonstrate how adaptive sampling strategies, coupled with high-resolution ocean forecasts, can optimize the deployment of autonomous platforms (gliders, AUVs) to maximize scientific return. The work integrates ocean modeling, path planning algorithms, and operational oceanography to enable intelligent, responsive observation systems.
