summary: Poster presentation on the relationship between large-scale climate variability and shelf circulation patterns in the northern South China Sea.

abstract: |
  This poster examines how large-scale climatic forcing influences the interannual variability of shelf circulation in the northern South China Sea. Using high-resolution numerical ocean models validated against observations, we identify the primary climate indices that drive circulation changes and quantify their impacts. Results show significant correlations between monsoon variability, ENSO phases, and shelf current strength, with important implications for regional oceanography and marine ecosystems.

## Poster Content

This poster presentation showcases research findings on the connection between climate variability and regional ocean circulation, including:

### Research Questions
- What climatic factors drive shelf circulation variability?
- How do ENSO and monsoon variations influence ocean currents?
- What are the physical mechanisms linking large-scale forcing to regional response?

### Key Results
- Strong correlation between climate indices and shelf circulation strength
- Monsoon-driven and ENSO-modulated variability patterns identified
- Physical mechanisms traced through momentum budget analysis
- Model-observation agreement validates findings

### Methodology
- High-resolution regional ocean modeling
- Statistical analysis of multi-year datasets
- EOF and correlation analysis
- Model validation against mooring and satellite data
