## Overview

This collaborative research project synthesizes recent advances in understanding the complex circulation patterns in the East China Sea (ECS) and surrounding waters. The ECS is a dynamic marginal sea with interactions between multiple current systems including the Kuroshio, Taiwan Warm Current, and coastal currents influenced by the Changjiang (Yangtze River) discharge.

## Research Components

### 1. Shelf Current Dynamics
- Origin, pathways, and destinations of shelf currents in the ECS and southern Yellow Sea
- Seasonal and interannual variations in current patterns
- Influence of monsoon forcing and river discharge

### 2. Kuroshio-Shelf Interactions
- Mechanisms of Kuroshio intrusion onto the shelf
- Exchange processes between the Kuroshio and shelf waters
- Impact on shelf circulation and water mass properties

### 3. Changjiang Estuary Circulation
- Coastal and estuarine circulation patterns (2000-2020)
- River plume dynamics and freshwater transport
- Influence on regional biogeochemistry and ecosystems

## Key Contributions

- **Comprehensive Synthesis**: Integrated findings from multiple studies to provide a holistic view of ECS circulation
- **Mechanistic Understanding**: Identified key physical processes governing circulation patterns
- **Regional Connectivity**: Examined linkages between different circulation systems
- **Temporal Variability**: Documented changes over recent decades (2000-2020)

## Methods & Data Sources

- Literature review and synthesis of observational studies
- Analysis of mooring data, satellite observations, and drifter trajectories
- Numerical model results from regional ocean circulation models
- Integration of multi-year datasets
