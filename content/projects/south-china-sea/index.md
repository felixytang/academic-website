## Overview

This project investigates how large-scale climate variability influences the circulation patterns on the continental shelf of the northern South China Sea. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for predicting regional ocean conditions and their impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities.

## Key Objectives

- Identify the primary climatic drivers of shelf circulation variability
- Quantify the interannual fluctuations in current patterns
- Analyze the mechanisms linking large-scale climate indices to regional circulation
- Examine the implications for coastal and shelf processes

## Key Findings

- Established relationships between climate indices (ENSO, monsoon variability) and shelf circulation patterns
- Quantified the magnitude and spatial patterns of circulation variability
- Identified key physical mechanisms mediating climate-ocean interactions
- Provided insights into predictability of regional ocean conditions

## Methods & Approach

- **Numerical Ocean Modeling**: High-resolution regional ocean model simulations
- **Climate Data Analysis**: EOF analysis, wavelet analysis, correlation studies
- **Model Validation**: Comparison with observational data and reanalysis products
- **Statistical Methods**: Multiple regression, composite analysis

## Significance

This work advances our understanding of how global climate variability affects regional ocean circulation, with implications for marine resource management, coastal planning, and climate prediction in the South China Sea region.
