Investigation of the variabilities, impacts, and driving mechanisms of Bering Strait throughflow using AO-FVCOM (Arctic Ocean Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model) and observational data.

## Overview

This research examines the seasonal and interannual variability of the Pacific water inflow through the Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean. The Bering Strait throughflow is a critical component of the Arctic Ocean circulation system, carrying heat, freshwater, and nutrients from the Pacific into the Arctic.

## Key Findings

- Quantified seasonal and interannual variability of Bering Strait throughflow using numerical modeling and observational validation
- Identified climatic forcing mechanisms controlling throughflow variations
- Analyzed the influence of Bering Strait inflow on Chukchi Sea ice area temporal-spatial variability
- Comprehensive review of Pacific inflow characteristics and influence factors

## Methods & Tools

- **AO-FVCOM**: Arctic Ocean Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model
- **Data Analysis**: Observational data integration and model-data comparison
- **Statistical Analysis**: Time series analysis, correlation studies, EOF analysis
