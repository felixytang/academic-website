## About Me

Yongfei Deng is a PhD student in Physical Oceanography at [Your University]. His research focuses on understanding ocean circulation dynamics, with particular emphasis on the Bering Strait throughflow and its impacts on Arctic and Pacific Ocean systems. He employs numerical ocean models (particularly FVCOM) combined with observational data to investigate the variability and mechanisms of ocean currents.

His recent work has examined climatic controls on shelf circulation in the South China Sea and the seasonal to interannual variability of the Bering Strait throughflow. He has also contributed to comprehensive reviews on circulation dynamics in the East China Sea and the Kuroshio-shelf current interactions.

Yongfei has published in leading oceanography journals including *Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans*, *Progress in Oceanography*, and *Frontiers in Marine Science*. He is passionate about advancing our understanding of ocean-climate interactions and their broader environmental impacts.
